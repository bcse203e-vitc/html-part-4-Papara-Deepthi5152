      <h2>Exploring the Future of Web Technologies</h2>
      <div class="columns">
        <p>
          The evolution of web technologies continues to accelerate, with tools like WebAssembly, Progressive Web Apps, and frameworks like React and Svelte transforming user experiences. Developers today are expected to deliver high-performance applications with offline capabilities and responsive interfaces across devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          WebAssembly allows running compiled code in the browser, opening the door to high-speed games and heavy computations in a web environment. Meanwhile, technologies like WebSockets and Server-Sent Events are revolutionizing real-time communication, pushing updates instantly without needing the user to refresh the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the frontend, component-based design and reactive data binding have become standard. Tools like Vite and esbuild are dramatically improving development build times, while Tailwind CSS is changing how styles are written in modern projects. The focus is shifting toward accessibility, performance, and maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, AI-driven web personalization, voice-activated interfaces, and AR/VR integrations will become mainstream. As developers, staying updated with these innovations ensures we build not only modern but also future-proof digital experiences for all.
